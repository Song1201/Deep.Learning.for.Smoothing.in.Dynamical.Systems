See usage.py file about how to run the programs. Use structuredInference.py 
file in the StructuredInference directory to run structured variational 
inference. The programs in StructuredInference directory are old code before 
refactorization. It runs separately from the other files.
 
1. All data in this project are 1 dimensional data. All programs only promise 
working on 1 dimensional data.

2. Parameters for training CNN point estimators for all 4 types of models: 
lr=2e-4, batchSize = 100, numEpoch = 200

3. Parameters for training RNN point estimators for all 4 types of models: 
lr=3e-4, batchSize = 100, numEpoch = 200
